# MIPS Simulator / Disassembler
Computer Architecture Project CDA4102/5155 <br/>
Not exactly compatible with MIPS as the instruction set has been modified to fit assignment.
 
1. Load a specified MIPS text file and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler). 
2. Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). 

This project takes in 32-bit MIPS instructions and produces two text files, simulation.txt and disassembly.txt. <br/>
1. simulation.txt contains the program trace of the register values and data values throughout the program running.
2. disassembly.txt contains the translation of the 32 bits into their instruction or data counterparts.
