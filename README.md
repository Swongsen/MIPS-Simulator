# MIPS Simulator / Disassembler
Computer Architecture Project CDA4102/5155
Not exactly compatible with MIPS as the instruction set has been modified to fit assignment.
 
1. Load a specified MIPS text file and generate the assembly code equivalent to the input file (disassembler). 
2. Generate the instruction-by-instruction simulation of the MIPS code (simulator). 

It should also produce/print the contents of registers and data memories after execution of each instruction.
